# Social gScholar

Social gScholar is a social web app developed to track and rank the daily networking, learning, and coding
activities of the gSchool students enrolled in the Denver Jun 2014 class. It was developed using Ruby, built
on Sinatra, and designed using Twitter Bootstrap primarily.

gSchool students register on the site and then log their daily activities using a pre-defined list of relevant
and related in-class and out-of-class activities.  Each activity has a related score.  Daily scores are tabulated
and students are ranked based on their combined scores over the trailing two weeks.

## Dev Details
The Social gScholar project was thrown together relatively quickly and intended for fun and internal use only.  While
it was fully developed with implementation/user-interface testing in mind, there is not a lick of unit testing involved.
As well, there are some obviously glaring best practices absent in its design.  (They are obvious when looking at the code.)
What you see in the code, is what has been learned and applied as of the 6 week mark of gSchool.  It is my intent to
remain 'pencils-down' on this app rather than further improving the code as my base of knowledge improves.
